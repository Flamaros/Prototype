 - Migrate the checkgl util method on the expirimental logger of std
 - Improve parameter value format of checkgl (pointer in hex, enum too, ...)

Optimization:
 - The instancing as to be dynamic just like the batching, because it depends of draw orders (object rendering groups, and sort for alpha objects,...). It will be nice to have a method handler that allow the user to customize this filtering.
